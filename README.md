# Rebel Game Engine
A simple game engine using C/C++ built mostly from scratch for learning purposes.

The engine is an application of the lessons I've learned researching game engines and poking around various open source projects. I don't plan to use it for production but it might eventually evolve into something that will. The primary goal for now is implementing the barest essentials. 

## Roadmap
v1.0

- [x] Window management
- [x] Drawing sprites
- [x] Coordinate system
- [ ] Camera System
- [ ] Loading 3D models
- [ ] Sprite transparency
- [ ] Text
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Save system

## Dependencies / External Libraries
As much as I want to implement everything myself, these libraries are just better so no need to re-invent the wheel.

  * [Glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) - OpenGL Loader-Generator
  * [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - For OpenGL and window handling
  * [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - Image loader

## Many thanks
This project wouldn't be possible without these:

  * [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) - The project that started my journey to appreciating hand-made programs and applications.
  * [LazyFoo's SDL Tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) - I did not use SDL for this engine but I learned about it using these excellent tutorials.
  * [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - An excellent site containing tutorials about OpenGL. Ramps up from beginner to advanced concepts quite nicely.
  * [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - An excellent game programming library that has very simple and readable code.
  * [Myriad Game Engine](https://github.com/jobtalle/Myriad) - A bare bones game engine that I used to learn about OpenGL loading without GLFW.
